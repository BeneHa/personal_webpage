            Hi, welcome to my webpage! Here I give an overview over my business and private life and some
            ways to contact me.</p>
        <p class="justify_text">I am 26 years old and am currently working for Mercedes-Benz as a Data Analyst. I mostly
            work
            in the Azure Cloud with various Azure tools, but my main focus is on Apache Spark on Azure Databricks. I
            like to
            solve all kinds of business problems using Cloud technology as efficiently as possible. I do that by trying
            to
            understand what is possible with Cloud technology and what is needed from a business perspective, which is
            why I
            am often the translator between the business and the tech world.</p>
        <p class="justify_text">Have a look around and feel free to contact me if you have questions!</p>
